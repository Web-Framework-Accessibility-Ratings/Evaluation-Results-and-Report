# Evaluation-Results-and-Report
Despite the existence of accessibility testing tools, software still largely inaccessible mainly due to lack of awareness among developers and issues with existing tools. This motivated us to evaluate the accessibility support of development tools that do not require specific accessibility knowledge such as web frameworks. We tested the accessibility support of three JavaScript web frameworks; Angular, React, and Vue. For each of the three frameworks, we built a web application with 32 pages, each of which violated a single accessibility guideline. We found that only React generated a warning for one of the accessibility violations that is lack of label for non-text content. The rest of the accessibility violations went unnoticed by the three frameworks.
